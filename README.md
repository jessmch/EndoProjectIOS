CALIT2 Endoscope Research Project
Author: Chau Ho
Area: iOS App Development
=================================================

The implementations that I have done in this project are as follows:
- Dark Mode feature
- Convert the size of each image to 400x400 as required
- Convert an array of images to animated version
- Implement Start button and its function (Start button can also act as Resume button)
- Implement Pause button and its function
- Implement Rewind button and its function
- User interface enhancement

=======================================================================

To open the application:
First, download Xcode by going to the website https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

After downloading Xcode, there are 2 ways that you can access the application:
The first method is to download the code as a zip file on Github. Please refer to this image to locate the download button: https://imgur.com/a/n2YgGWz. Then, extract the files in zip file, and use Xcode to run it.

The second method is to click on “Open with Xcode” after installing Xcode. I would recommend using this method since it is faster to access the iOS application.
